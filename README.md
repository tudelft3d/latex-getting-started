# Quick LaTeX course

## LaTeX installation


### Online environment: Overleaf

To start, we recommend you use the [online LaTeX environment Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) since it has a full installation of LaTeX and there is nothing to install.
If you login with your TUDelft email, you get extra features (TUDelft pays for it).

### Local installation

If you want to use LaTeX locally (it's faster to compile) then you need either:

  - [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/about) (Windows) 
  - [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex) (macOS). 
  - [TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive) (Linux)


## Getting started

The best is to follow the [Overleaf's Learn LaTeX in 30min](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes) to start.

The only crucial thing missing from it is how to add references, for this we suggest you use "natbib" ([tutorial about bibliography management with natbib](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_with_natbib)).


## Tips and tricks for LaTeX

In the file `template/mytemplate.tex` you can find tips and tricks to do most of the useful things in LaTeX.

Use it as the template for submitting your homeworks for instance.


## Which software to use? (if you don't use Overleaf)
