## LaTeX installation


### Online environment: Overleaf

To start, we recommend you use the [online LaTeX environment Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) since it has a full installation of LaTeX and there is nothing to install.
If you login with your TUDelft email, you get extra features (TUDelft pays for it).

### Local installation

If you want to use LaTeX locally (it's faster to compile) then you need either:

  - [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/about) (Windows) 
  - [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex) (macOS). 
  - [TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive) (Linux)


## Getting started

The best is to follow the [Overleaf's Learn LaTeX in 30min](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes) to start.

The only crucial thing missing from it is how to add references, for this we suggest you use "natbib" ([tutorial about bibliography management with natbib](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_with_natbib)).


## Tips and tricks for LaTeX

In the file `template/mytemplate.tex` you can find tips and tricks to do most of the useful things in LaTeX.

Use it as the template for submitting your homeworks for instance.


## Which software to use? 

### Editors (if you don't use Overleaf)

  - [TeXnicCenter](http://www.texniccenter.org) (Windows)
  - [TeXStudio](https://www.texstudio.org/) (cross-platform)
  - [TeXshop](http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/) (macOS; which is bundled with MacTeX)
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as generic editor with the [LaTeX Workshop plugin](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop)
  - [Texmaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) (cross-platform)
  - [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) (cross-platform; TeX support can be added through [package control](https://packagecontrol.io) with the LaTeXTools package; also with package control you can get a nice linter called SublimeLinter with TeX support through SublimeLinter-chktex)

### Managing references

  - [JabRef](http://jabref.sourceforge.net) (cross-platform)
  - [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) (cross-platform; integrations for Office and browsers; use a plugin like [better bibtex](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/))
  - [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) (cross-platform; integrations for Office and browsers; integrates with Overleaf professional accounts)
  - [BibDesk](https://bibdesk.sourceforge.io) (macOS)

### Drawing figures

  - Adobe Illustrator (nice, but €€€)
  - [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/es/designer/full-feature-list/) (macOS, iPadOS and Windows; €€ but way less than Adobe)
  - [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) (cross-platform)
  - [IPE](http://ipe.otfried.org/) (cross-platform; integrates LaTeX text; great for triangulation and geometric stuff)

### Drawing flowcharts

  - [MathCha](https://www.mathcha.io/)
  - [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/)
  - [OmniGraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle) (macOS and iOS; nice, but €€€)

### Equation writers

  - Grapher (macOS Utilities) Graphical interface to write equations that offers the option to copy them as LaTeX expression
  - LaTeXiT (macOS) utility to write equations in LaTeX and export them for use in other software

### Help to make tables

  - [Tables Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/) (LaTeX tables are tough to type and align, this helps greatly to start)# latex-getting-started
